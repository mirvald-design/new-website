			<p>Hi, I'm Vadym, a multidisciplinary designer. 👨‍💻<br>
				<br>
				In a nutshell 🤗<br>
				<br>
				I design experiences for people, with a focus on services, platforms and apps.<br>

				I like being multidisciplinary - it helps me better understand the world around us.<br>

				My passion keeps me constantly updating and trying new things.<br>

				I also believe that new ideas require new ways of working, that user experience is not limited to digital
				products, it applies to everything from spoons to software.<br>

				Having a holistic approach aligned with the story that needs to be told gives me the ability to solve
				problems.<br>
				<br>
				Why work with me 🙌<br>
				<br>
				- I help companies and entrepreneurs find personal solutions to the most complex problems.<br>
				- I come up with concepts for new products and projects.<br>
				- I accompany the launch and support and development of the product.<br>
				- Researching business and processes.<br>
				- I find opportunities for transformation and options for launching new projects.<br>
				- I save resources and choose flexible solutions for limited budgets and deadlines, without losing quality.<br>
				- Each task is solved jointly with developers who have relevant competencies and experience.<br>
				- I follow trends and new technologies, I am actively practicing.<br>
				- I sift out unnecessary things, leaving only the tried and most relevant.<br>
				<br>
				My job is to figure out everything that will help your business become more efficient and technologically
				advanced.<br>
				<br>
				I work with entrepreneurs and large businesses, as well as those who are just planning to launch their own
				business.
				No restrictions on the type of activity and size of the company.<br>
				<br>
				If you want to work together, just text me 💬
